# Hexapod-robot-with-raspberry-pi-
Building and programming a hexapod robot with raspberry pi as main cpu

I  got the robot with assembled, what i did was programming so here i will 
explain how the code works and how can you program your own hexapod robot 

So first i will explain the matematics that i use to program the robot 
I used invers kinematic for this, i learned fundamentals on this webside
so check it out if you want, but i will explain it here too
